/**
 *  These type of questions can be solved using heap (priority queue).
 *
 *  First, pick the biggest two.
 *  Then decrement both by one and store them back.
 *  Continue until biggest element is 0.
 *
 *  Note that some elements can be negative at the end but it does not matter.
 *  Because we are trying to diminish all containers.
 *  If two containers are diminished to zero but a container still has some elements in it
 *  we can continue to decrement two containers because we are decementing single containers by one.
 *
 *  Explaination above reminds heap data structure.
 *  Heap data structure keeps data in ordered manner, when you modify the heap, ie. adding an element,
 *  order maintains itself.
 *
 *  You can either push/pop elements or access to top element.
 *
 *  Time complexity: O(n * log3), n refers to summation of all sizes.
