/** Information about Reverse Polish Notation (Postorder Notation)
 *
 *  For ex: 4 + 6 x 2
 *  First: 6 x 2 = 12
 *  Then: 4 + 12 = 16 
 *
 *  This notation is called inorder notation.
 *  This notation is problematic and counterintuitive for implementing mathematical calculations for computers.
 *  Solution: Stack based calculator (Last In First Out)
 *
 *  From the example above, we can write this equation as 4 6 2 x + (Reverse Polish Notation) 
 *  First: Take 4, 6 and 2;
 *  In stack there are 4 6 2,
 *
 *  Since every mathematical operator is binary (takes two operands) when an operator comes,
 *  take last two elements from stack and do math operation then push result back to stack.
 *
 *  x, 6 x 2 = 12, push 12 to stack, stack is: 4 12
 *  +, 4 + 12 = 16, push 16 to stack, result is 16.
 *
 *  Time complexity: O(n), n refers to size of string vector.
