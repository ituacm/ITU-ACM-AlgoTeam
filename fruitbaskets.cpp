/*
* We'll collect at most two different types of fruits continuously in an array, starting with any desired index.
* Basically, it asks to find the longest length of the subarray containing at most two elements.
*
* Main focus is the second fruit, if there is a new fruit we let the first fruit be the second fruit and
* the new fruit be the new one. Keep track of the maximum of all current picks.
