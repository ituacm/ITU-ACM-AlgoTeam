    Problem Description:
    
        We are given an UNDIRECTED graph of n nodes.
        The nodes are 0-indexed, which means in adjacency
        list we do not need to use 1 additional memory for
        1-index nodes.
        Then, we are given succProb vector, which displays
        us the propability of the edge between 2 nodes.
        Finally, we are given start and end inputs to
        know from which node to start and end.
        
        Note: The probability is calculated by multiplying.
        
        Example:
            The Graph:
                (0) ---> (1), with the weight of 0.8
                (0) ---> (2), weight = 0.6
                (1) ---> (3), weight = 0.1
                (2) ---> (3), weight = 0.9
                
            starting point is 0, ending point is 3.
            Totally there is 2 way of coming to the node 3
            starting from the node 1. 
            First is (0) ---> (1) ---> (3), probability = 0.08
            Second is (0) ---> (2) ---> (3), probability = 0.54
        
            Because 0.54 is bigger than 0.08, we will return 0.54
        
    
    Data types, structures, and algorithms used for this question:
        We will use Data Types of bool, int, and double.
            bool -> for visited vector to check if the node is visited or not.
            int -> for the node numbers.
            double -> for the probability.
        
        As a Data Structures:
            vector<vector<pair<int, double>>> for adjacency list,
            adjacency list is more efficient than adjacency matrix
            when used in Dijkstra algorithm.
            
            We will also use vectors as a data structure for
            visited and probabilities array, to check if the
            node is visited or not, and to store the probabilities
            of each node,
            
            Priority Queue will be used for Dijkstra algorithm.
        
        As an Algorithm:
            As I mention above, we will use Dijkstra algorithm, 
            normally Dijsktra is used for finding the minimum distance
            or probability, but we will use it reversely for maximum.
