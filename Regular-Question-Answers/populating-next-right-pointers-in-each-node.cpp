* Node definition
class Node {
public:
    int val;
    Node* left;
    Node* right;
    Node* next;

    Node() : val(0), left(NULL), right(NULL), next(NULL) {}

*
* Next pointer is the pointer to the next node of the same level.
*
* Since we'll update the 'next' pointers of the nodes, we can use bfs to traverse the tree.
* Thus we'll use a queue to store the nodes of the current layer.
* Whenever we pop from the queue, it will have the right child first, then the left child.
* The temp pointer will be used to keep track of that linearity of the nodes, ending with the right most node's next pointer being NULL.
* We'll update the next pointer of the current node to the temp node.
* (The question guarantees that the tree is a perfect binary tree, so we can check the leaf condition by checking only one child.)
