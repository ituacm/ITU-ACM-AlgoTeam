/**
 * In this question, we have been asked to revert bits of a given number.
 * Ex: 01010000 --> 00001010
 *
 * For these operations, we will use unsigned 32 bit numbers (uint32_t)
 * We will use bit manimulations extensively.
 * & : logical and
 * | : logical or
 * << : left shift (multiplying by two)
 * >> : right shift (dividing by two)

         * If result of ANDing number and mask is not zero, mark that bit from left.
         * Ex : (8 bits)   10101100
         *         maskR : 00000100
         * result of AND : 00000100
         * Result is not 0, our right mask was at 3rd bit from right (shifted two times to left)
         * So we will shift MaskL 2 rimes to right, and OR result (uint32_t) with mask
