 * Question Link: https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-number-of-operations-to-make-array-continuous/
 *
 * Time Complexity: O(N * logN)
 * Space Complexity: O(N)
 *
 * Here is the intuition for this problem:
 * If we want to make the minimum number of operations, we must find the maximum
 * number of numbers that we can keep.
 * Now let's examine the restrictions given in the question:
 * 1) Resulting array must consist of unique elements. If the array size is N, there will be N different numbers.
 * 2) The difference between the maximum element and the minimum element is N - 1 (N denotes size of the array)
 * So, if we know the minimum element, we can find the maximum of this resulting array.
 * Assume minimum is X: maximum will be X + N - 1
 * All the elements in between will be larger than X and less than X + N - 1.
 * There is one thing to notice here:
 * Since there are N elements, and we know two of them, we must find the remaining
 * N - 2 elements. We know the range of them. In order to fit N - 2 numbers into the
 * range (X, X + N - 1), we must start counting from X until X + N - 1 and increment
 * by 1 at a time. Our resulting array doesn't have to be sorted, but if it was, this would
 * be how it looked like. We want to transform the given array into this form, and in order to achieve
 * that in minimum number of operations, we must find the maximum length continuous sequence and
 * change the remaining ones.
